## Disclaimer of warranty:  
Because there is not much time for it, creating this repository is only for sharing. Therefore, the problems you encounter will be rare or may not be solved (For example, you use tab pinning, bookmark, Zen Web Panels and tab groups,... but I don't, so I don't write custom code for it).

## Corresponding configuration:  
1. Configuration for Windows:
 * Show accent color on title bar and window borders: Enable.
2. Configuration for Zen Browser:
